How to: the password was inside a file named "-". This type of file is hard to interact through terminal. The trick is to write the full filename, in this case "./-".

How to: the filename had spaces, but this one I already knew how to solve, using \ befor the spaces to allow the terminal to interpret em.

How to: the trick here was to use the * to reprensent all the files in the directory, once I runned the file command to see what type o file was with the * ans it listed that only one was not data, I did a cat command to the file and boom!

How to: I'm a little lost in this one, not gonna lie. In the end I managed to find the correct file using a file -size 1033c command but not sure why it works yet. The c specifies the bytes as gemini told me but I do not undestend why.
